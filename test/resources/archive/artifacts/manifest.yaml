# This file is the manifest to determine which built items are copied to the
# hosted/Box file server locations. The versions that are specified within
# parenthesis below *must* match the versions from the version.properties file.
# They can also be overridden by passing values to the harvester script. ${see -versions}.
# It is best to keep the files and folders alphabetized because it makes it easier
# to compare the manifest to the filesystem. The exception to this is the ee/ce folder
# since most of the important artifacts are in the ee folder.

# Sample manifest file for testing purposes
